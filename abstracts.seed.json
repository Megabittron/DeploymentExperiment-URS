        "abstractContent": "One in ten Americans prefer to fall asleep in denim jeans instead of pajamas. However, 100% of scientists agree that sleeping in jeans is less comfortable than pajamas. How a small portion of Americans have fallen into favor of sleeping in jeans is the focal point of this research. This historical study of archived diaries, newspapers and jeans salesmen from the Morris area reveals the original intent of denim jeans, as they were created for and marketed by John Denison Jeansington: Jeans are not comfort pants. They're not. They're like the Chevy old timey Chevy truck pants. It's not like a sleek pants that say “Look at me fly around these curves! I got to get a load of lumber to the mill!” That's what jeans are. Denim was-- denim was invented, so that like, cows, when they bit you, it didn't hurt very bad. The study ends with a reflection on how this view may have fallen out of fashion and suggests primary sources for followup research.",
